# A-B-Testing-using-Python
A/B Testing means analyzing two marketing strategies to choose the best marketing strategy that can convert more traffic into sales (or more traffic into your desired goal) effectively and efficiently.
In A/B testing, we analyze the results of two marketing strategies to choose the best one for future marketing campaigns.For example: 1)An online retailer might test different product descriptions to see which one leads to more sales.
2)A digital advertising campaign might test different ad copy to see which version results in a higher click-through rate.
