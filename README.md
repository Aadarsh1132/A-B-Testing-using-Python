# A-B-Testing-using-Python
A/B Testing means analyzing two marketing strategies to choose the best marketing strategy that can convert more traffic into sales (or more traffic into your desired goal) effectively and efficiently.
In A/B testing, we analyze the results of two marketing strategies to choose the best one for future marketing campaigns.For example: 1)An online retailer might test different product descriptions to see which one leads to more sales.
2) A digital advertising campaign might test different ad copy to see which version results in a higher click-through rate.

Your goal can be to boost sales, followers, or traffic, but when we choose the best marketing strategy according to the results of our previous marketing campaigns, it is nothing but A/B testing.

For the task of A/B testing, we need to have a dataset about two different marketing strategies for the same goal.

The dataset we are using here contains two data files about two marketing campaigns (Control Campaign and Test Campaign).
